# Ant Colony Optimization for Traveling Salesman Problem
Ant Colony Optimization is implemeted and investigated for Traveling Salesman Problem in ECE457A. The distance matrix is calculated using `cities.csv`.

## Usage
ACO are implemented with or without online update of pheromone. In each case, the effect of pheromone persistant constant, state transition control parameter and population size are investigated and best solution cost plots are generated.
